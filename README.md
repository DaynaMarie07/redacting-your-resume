Updating my resume

Hello! 
My name is Dayna Payne, owner of Hello Darling Studios. I am a graduate of F.I.R.S.T. Institute in Orlando Florida where I studied Graphic Design and Web Development. I absolutely loved coding and building websites! I pursued my passion for programming by going to the UCF coding program, where I gained knowledge and experience with both front and back-end development. I am also a passionate photographer with years of experience with Adobe software, which I love to incorporate into my clients website we needed. I am dedicated to my work and self-motivated.
